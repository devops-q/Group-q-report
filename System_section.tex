\section{System perspective} \label{sp}
%% Short introduction to this section
\subsection{Design and architecture} %% phbl 
%% A description of how Minitwit works, including design choices for choosing different architectures.

%% Include a benchmark between using python, C# and Golang. This is to motivate, why we choose Golang. 

\subsection{Dependencies} %% alpl
%% a description of what is needed to make minitwit work

%% A description of all the different components that we have made. This includes docker, terraform, ansible, github actions, prometheus, .... , and so on.

\subsection{Important interactions} % micje
%% A description of how interactions are made, and processed in the system. This should include an UML Sequence diagram, showing the aforementioned flow. 

%% This needs to be done both on an API level and a GUI-based level?

\subsection{Current state} %% msro
%% A overview description of our results from the CI chain - testing,  Codeclimate and sonarqube. Everything is passing! 
%% Be sure to include metrics. 
We used several static analysis tools and tests to keep the
code in good shape. The current, most recent implementation
is working correctly and passing all tests: Go linter, Go 
tests, web end-to-end tests, terraform linter, and terraform 
observability check.

Below are overviews of two static code analysis tools applied to the 
current implementation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SonarQube: 0 security issues (grade A), 5 reliability issues
    (grade C), 17 maintainability issues (grade A), 2.3\% code duplication
    (Below the suggested 3\% threshold).
    \item CodeClimate: maintainability grade A, 5 code smells, 2 duplications,
    0 other issues.
\end{itemize}

Most code duplication and reliability issues can be found in 
the end-to-end tests.

%% THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE SECTION, WE NEED TO ARGUE FOR CHOICES.
